    "### Galaxy Zoo Project\n",
    "Galaxy Zoo is a citizen science project that enlists volunteers to visually classify galaxies based on their morphology using images from various telescopes ([Lintott et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13689.x)). With immense contributions from citizen scientists, this effort has yielded large, labeled data sets well suited for large-scale data analysis in astronomy. We will work with Galaxy Zoo 2, which involves classified images of ~240,000 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ([Willett et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stt1458); [Hart et al., 2016](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/461/4/3663/2608720)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Swin Transformer\n",
    "We will process the galaxy images with a **Swin Transformer**, a hierarchical vision transformer model that computes self-attention within shifted windows, achieving state-of-the-art performance on computer vision tasks ([Liu et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030)). Its design enables efficient computation and scalability to various image resolutions, making it suitable for diverse applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we'll work with a Swin Transformer pretrained on the ImageNet dataset: a large-scale image database containing millions of labeled images across 1,000 categories like cats, dogs, oil filters, and balloons. Although a model trained on such images may not appear useful for galaxy classification, we'll find that this pre-trained Swin Transformer is a generally effective tool for extracting information from images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embeddings\n",
    "Nabeel and Ved have run all ~240,000 Galaxy Zoo 2 images through this pre-trained Swin Transformer, producing **embeddings**. These embeddings are dense 1D vector representations of the data, ideally capturing all useful information in the image in a low-dimensional space.\n",

    "This `DataFrame` contains information on the 240,000 galaxies classified in the Galaxy Zoo 2 project. Notable columns including the following\n",
    "\n",
    "`morphology` is a string describing the shape/type of the galaxy. For astronomers, these are similar to but not identical to the standard Hubble Tuning Fork types. Morphologies beginning with `E` are galaxies with smooth light profiles. Their degree of roundless is encoded by the following character: `r` for completely round, `i` for in-between, and `c` for cigar-shaped. Morphologies beginning with `S` are galaxies with disks. Edge-on disks follow `S` with `er`, `eb`, or `en` for having a round, boxy, or no bulge respectively. Face-on disks have `B` following `S` if they show a bar and `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` next encoding the prominance of the bulge: dominant, obvious, just noticable, and none, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "`REDSHIFT` is a float containing the spectroscopic redshift of the galaxy. In simplest terms, redshift ($z$) is a measure of distance from us where larger values indicate greater distances and a minimum at $z=0$, indicating no distance from us.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Where relevant, Galaxy Zoo citizen scientists also indicate additional information, like the presence of a ring shape (`ring`), an arc resulting from lensing (`lens/arc`), a galaxy with disturbed morphology (`disturbed`), irregular morphology (`irregular`), a galaxy merger (`merger`), a prominent dust lane (`dust lane`), or something else (`other`). For face-on disk galaxies, the count of spiral arms is available (`arm_count`; `+` indicates more than 4 arms) and how tightly they are wound (`arm_winding`; tightly `t`, moderately `m`, and loosely `l`).\n",
    "\n",
    "`asset_id` can be used for fetching the image of a galaxy. We've provided a helpful `show_image_by_assetid()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "`embedding_0` to `embedding_767` represent the 1D embedding vector we produced with the pre-trained Swin transformer. We've extracted these into a 2D array where each row is an embedding that corresponds to the galaxy in the same row of `gz_df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many other features are available like the brightness of the galaxy in `UGRIZ` bands are also available. We also include the sky coordinates and `SDSS` DR7 object IDs in case you'd like to gather other information on these galaxies."
