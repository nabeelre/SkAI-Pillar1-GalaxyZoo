# SkAI-PillarI-GalaxyZoo
This repository contains the Galaxy Zoo activity for the May 7th SkAI Pillar I Research Event.

We have run the Galaxy Zoo 2 images through a pre-trained Swin Transformer and designed several exploratory tasks suitable for participants with varying levels of expertise in astronomy and machine learning. Pillar-I.ipynb walks the user through these activities.
